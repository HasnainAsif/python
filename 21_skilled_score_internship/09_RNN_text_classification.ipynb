Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one, and survived.\n"

Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it.

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",

      "Review tf.Tensor(b'Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the very last of the series, and like part 4, it\\'s unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that it\\'s a Christmas-themed horror flick.<br /><br />Except to the oblivious, there\\'s some obvious things going on here...Mickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and his creepy son\\'s name is Pino. Ring a bell, anyone? Now, a little boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one evening, and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him. Even though it said \"don\\'t open till Christmas\", he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself. Inside is a little red ball that sprouts Santa arms and a head, and proceeds to kill dad. Oops, maybe he should have left well-enough alone. Of course Derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs, but he doesn\\'t grow up to be some killer Santa, he just stops talking.<br /><br />There\\'s a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes. We even see him buying a bunch when Derek\\'s mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma. And what exactly is this guy doing? Well, we\\'re not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick. He does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a \"Larry the Larvae\" toy for his kid, but of course \"Larry\" is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course, well, things aren\\'t pretty.<br /><br />Anyway, eventually what\\'s going on with Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a \"real boy\". Pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from \"Kenitalia\" (a smooth plastic crotch) so that could account for his evil ways. And the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too, and there\\'s even kind of a happy ending of sorts. Whee.<br /><br />A step up from part 4, but not much of one. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. A few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that doesn\\'t really make any difference. Anyway, I now have seeing the whole series out of my system.

    "This tutorial showed how to train a binary classifier from scratch on the IMDB dataset. As an exercise, you can modify this notebook to train a multi-class classifier to predict the tag of a programming question on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A [dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/stack_overflow_16k.tar.gz) has been prepared for you to use containing the body of several thousand programming questions (for example, \"How can I sort a dictionary by value in Python?\") posted to Stack Overflow. Each of these is labeled with exactly one tag (either Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java). Your task is to take a question as input, and predict the appropriate tag, in this case, Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will work with contains several thousand questions extracted from the much larger public Stack Overflow dataset on [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/stack-exchange/stack-overflow), which contains more than 17 million posts.\n",

    "To complete this exercise, you should modify this notebook to work with the Stack Overflow dataset by making the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of your notebook, update the code that downloads the IMDB dataset with code to download the [Stack Overflow dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/stack_overflow_16k.tar.gz) that has already been prepared. As the Stack Overflow dataset has a similar directory structure, you will not need to make many modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the last layer of your model to `Dense(4)`, as there are now four output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When compiling the model, change the loss to `tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)`. This is the correct loss function to use for a multi-class classification problem, when the labels for each class are integers (in this case, they can be 0, *1*, *2*, or *3*). In addition, change the metrics to `metrics=['accuracy']`, since this is a multi-class classification problem (`tf.metrics.BinaryAccuracy` is only used for binary classifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When plotting accuracy over time, change `binary_accuracy` and `val_binary_accuracy` to `accuracy` and `val_accuracy`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once these changes are complete, you will be able to train a multi-class classifier. "
