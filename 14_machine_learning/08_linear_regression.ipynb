    "Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear function can be represented as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = mx + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- y is the response\n",
    "- x is the feature\n",
    "- m is the slope\n",
    "- c is the intercept\n",
    "- m and c are the coefficients of the model\n",
    "  \n",
    "The model is trained on a dataset with features(x) and target(y). It learns the values of coefficients m and c that minimize the difference between actual values in the dataset and predicted values by the model. The difference between actual values and predicted values is known as the cost function. The model optimizes the cost function using the gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression as it takes more than one feature to predict the response. The linear function can be represented as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + ... + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- y is the response\n",
    "- x1, x2, x3, ... are the features\n",
    "- m1, m2, m3, ... are the coefficients of the model\n",
    "- c is the intercept\n",
    "- m1, m2, m3, ... and c are the coefficients of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on a dataset with features(x) and target(y). It learns the values of coefficients m1, m2, m3, ... and c that minimize the difference between actual values in the dataset and predicted values by the model.

    "\n",
    "- **R2 Score**: 0.9189 - This value indicates that approximately 91.89% of the variance in the dependent variable (price) is predictable from the independent variables. An R2 score close to 1 indicates a good fit.\n",
    "    > `e.g:` if the R2 score is 0.9189, it means that 91.89% of the variance in the price can be explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 736.91 - This value represents the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.\n",
    "    > `e.g:` if the MAE is 736.91, it means that, on average, the model's predictions are off by $736.91.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 0.3951 - This value represents the average absolute percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.\n",
    "    > `e.g:` if the MAPE is 0.3951, it means that, on average, the model's predictions are off by 39.51%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 1135.26 - This value is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the average magnitude of the error. Lower values indicate better performance.\n",

We also evaluated the model's performance using various metrics such as MSE, R2 score, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. The results indicate that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data but has room for improvement in terms of accuracy."
